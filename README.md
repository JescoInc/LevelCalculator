# LevelCalculator
Based on the calculator used at http://rsdo.net/rsdonline/guides/Experience%20formula.html#VisualBasic. I converted the code to allow for usage with the C# programming language and made it a bit more exact by showing the non pretty decimal values for the output, Which in turn will also make it more accurate.
